## Sidenote about versions

kermitproject.org's archives have a .tar and a .zip for MS-DOS kermit.
Unfortunately, they are very different. The tar has a lot of extra
files, but seems to be for Kermit 3.14. The zip is only for Kermit 3.16.

netlab1.net has confusing source code for Kermit, it offers several
versions:

* netlab's 3.16 beta 10: Files are same as kermitproject.org's 3.16 (1999)
* netlab's "3.16"      : Files are same as 3.15 (1997) except MSSDEF.H
* netlab's SOURCE      : same as above (3.15 except MSSDEF.H)
